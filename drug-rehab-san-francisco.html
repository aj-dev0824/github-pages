Individuals should verify their benefits and understand any prior authorization requirements before beginning treatment.</p>

                <h3>What types of addiction do you treat?</h3>
                <p>San Francisco rehab centers treat various substance use disorders, including alcohol addiction, prescription drug abuse, heroin and opioid addiction, cocaine and stimulant abuse, and marijuana dependence. Many facilities also address behavioral addictions and co-occurring mental health disorders that commonly accompany substance abuse.</p>

                <h3>Is drug detox necessary before rehab?</h3>
                <p>Medical detox is often necessary for individuals who have developed physical dependence on drugs or alcohol. However, not everyone requires formal detox services. Assessment by medical professionals determines whether detox is necessary based on substance use patterns, health status, and withdrawal risk factors. Many rehab centers provide detox services on-site or can arrange appropriate medical clearance before treatment begins.</p>
