            <h2>FAQ - Addiction Treatment Center Los Angeles</h2>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3>What types of addictions are treated at addiction centers in Los Angeles?</h3>
                <p>Los Angeles addiction treatment centers treat a comprehensive range of substance use disorders including alcohol addiction, opioid dependence, prescription drug abuse, cocaine addiction, methamphetamine addiction, and polysubstance use disorders. Many centers also provide dual diagnosis treatment for co-occurring mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and trauma-related disorders.</p>

                <h3>How long is the typical treatment program?</h3>
                <p>Treatment program length varies based on individual needs, severity of addiction, and level of care required. Medical detoxification typically lasts 5-7 days, while residential treatment programs commonly range from 30 to 90 days. Intensive outpatient programs usually last 8-12 weeks, though some individuals may continue in less intensive outpatient care for several months or longer.</p>

                <h3>Do treatment centers accept insurance?</h3>
                <p>Most reputable addiction treatment centers in Los Angeles accept various insurance plans and work with clients to maximize their benefits. The Affordable Care Act requires most insurance plans to cover substance abuse treatment as an essential health benefit. Coverage typically includes detoxification, inpatient treatment, outpatient services, and medications used in addiction treatment.</p>

                <h3>What is the difference between inpatient and outpatient rehab?</h3>
                <p>Inpatient rehab provides 24/7 residential care in a structured treatment environment, typically lasting 30-90 days. Clients live at the facility and participate in intensive daily programming. Outpatient rehab allows clients to live at home while attending treatment sessions at scheduled times, ranging from intensive programs (15-20 hours per week) to less intensive options (3-5 hours per week).</p>

                <h3>How confidential is the treatment?</h3>
                <p>Addiction treatment is protected by strict confidentiality laws, including HIPAA and 42 CFR Part 2, which specifically govern substance abuse treatment records. These laws generally prohibit treatment centers from disclosing any information about a client's presence in treatment or treatment details without written consent. The confidentiality protections are stronger than those for general medical care.</p>

                <h3>What happens after completing treatment?</h3>
                <p>Successful recovery extends beyond initial treatment completion. Most programs include comprehensive aftercare planning that may involve ongoing outpatient therapy, support group participation, sober living arrangements, family therapy, and regular check-ins with treatment providers. Many facilities offer alumni programs and ongoing support services to help maintain long-term recovery.</p>
