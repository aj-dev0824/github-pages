            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Alcohol Detox in Austin</h2>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3>How long does alcohol detox take?</h3>
                <p>The duration of alcohol detox varies depending on individual factors such as the length and severity of alcohol use, overall health, age, and whether you've experienced withdrawal before. Most people complete the acute withdrawal phase within 3-7 days, though some symptoms may persist for several weeks. Our medical team will monitor your progress and determine when it's safe to transition to the next level of care.</p>

                <h3>Is alcohol detox painful?</h3>
                <p>While alcohol detox can involve uncomfortable symptoms, our medical team works diligently to minimize discomfort through appropriate medications and supportive care. We use evidence-based protocols to manage symptoms and ensure your safety throughout the process. Many people are surprised to find that professional detox is much more comfortable than attempting to quit on their own.</p>

                <h3>What is the cost of alcohol detox in Austin?</h3>
                <p>The cost of alcohol detox varies depending on the level of care needed, length of stay, and specific services provided. We accept most major insurance plans and can help verify your benefits and coverage options. Our admissions team will work with you to understand your financial options and develop a payment plan if needed. Don't let cost concerns prevent you from seeking the help you need.</p>

                <h3>Can family members visit during inpatient detox?</h3>
                <p>We understand the importance of family support during recovery and generally encourage family involvement in the treatment process. Visiting policies vary depending on your individual treatment plan and medical condition. Our staff will discuss appropriate family involvement and visiting schedules during admission. Family education and support services are also available to help your loved ones understand addiction and how they can best support your recovery.</p>

                <h3>Are medications used during alcohol detox?</h3>
                <p>Yes, medications are commonly used during alcohol detox to prevent complications and reduce discomfort.

All medications are prescribed and monitored by our medical team to ensure safety and effectiveness.</p>

                <h3>What happens if I relapse after detox?</h3>
                <p>Relapse is unfortunately common in early recovery, but it doesn't mean treatment has failed. If relapse occurs, it's important to seek help immediately as your tolerance may have decreased, increasing the risk of overdose. Our team provides ongoing support and can help you re-enter treatment quickly. Many successful long-term recovery stories include initial relapses that became learning experiences.</p>

                <h3>How do I know if I need inpatient or outpatient detox?</h3>
                <p>The appropriate level of care depends on several factors including your drinking history, previous withdrawal experiences, medical conditions, mental health status, and home environment. Our admissions team conducts thorough assessments to determine the safest and most effective treatment level. When in doubt, higher levels of care are recommended for safety.</p>
