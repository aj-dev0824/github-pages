            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3>What is the duration of detox treatment in Escondido?</h3>
                <p>Detox duration varies depending on several factors including the substance used, length of addiction, physical health status, and individual response to treatment. Most detox programs last between 3-10 days, with medical supervision continuing until withdrawal symptoms stabilize and patients are ready for the next phase of treatment.</p>

                <h3>Is medical detox safe for everyone?</h3>
                <p>Medical detox is the safest approach to withdrawal from alcohol and drugs. However, individual medical conditions may require special considerations. Our comprehensive assessment process identifies any factors that could impact detox safety, and our medical team develops appropriate protocols to address these concerns.</p>

                <h3>Does insurance cover detox services in Escondido?</h3>
                <p>Most insurance plans provide coverage for medically necessary detox services. Coverage levels vary by plan, but many patients find that their out-of-pocket costs are manageable. Our insurance verification team works with each patient to maximize benefits and minimize costs.</p>

                <h3>What should I expect during the detox process?</h3>
                <p>The detox experience varies by individual, but most patients can expect initial assessment, medical monitoring, medication management if appropriate, and supportive therapies. Our team provides detailed information about what to expect and maintains open communication throughout the process.</p>

                <h3>Are aftercare and continuing support available after detox?</h3>
                <p>Yes, successful recovery requires ongoing support beyond detox. We provide referrals to appropriate continuing care options including residential treatment, intensive outpatient programs, regular outpatient therapy, and support groups. Care coordination ensures smooth transitions and continued progress.</p>

                <h3>What types of addiction does your facility treat?</h3>
                <p>Our detox center treats addiction to all major substances including alcohol, opioids (heroin, prescription painkillers), stimulants (cocaine, methamphetamine), benzodiazepines, and other drugs. We also provide support for individuals with polysubstance addiction and co-occurring mental health conditions.</p>

                <h3>Can family members be involved in the treatment process?</h3>
                <p>Family involvement is strongly encouraged as part of comprehensive addiction treatment. We offer family education programs, support groups for loved ones, and family therapy sessions to help repair relationships and build strong recovery support systems.</p>
