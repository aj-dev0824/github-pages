            <h2>Understanding Inpatient Drug Rehab</h2>

            <p>Inpatient drug rehab involves residing at a treatment facility for an extended period, typically ranging from 30 to 90 days, though some programs may extend longer based on individual needs. This residential drug treatment approach provides comprehensive care that addresses both the physical and psychological aspects of addiction. Unlike outpatient programs, inpatient facilities offer 24-hour medical supervision, structured daily schedules, and immediate access to crisis intervention when needed.</p>

            <p>The treatment process typically begins with a thorough assessment to determine the appropriate level of care and develop an individualized treatment plan. Addiction recovery programs incorporate evidence-based therapies, medical interventions, and holistic approaches tailored to each patient's unique circumstances. The residential setting creates a therapeutic community where individuals can focus entirely on recovery without the distractions and temptations of daily life.</p>

            <h3>Who Should Consider Inpatient Rehab?</h3>

            <p>Several factors indicate that inpatient drug rehab Columbus may be the most appropriate treatment option. Individuals with severe addiction, multiple failed outpatient attempts, or co-occurring mental health disorders often benefit most from intensive treatment. Those whose substance use poses immediate health risks or who lack stable, supportive home environments are prime candidates for residential care.</p>
